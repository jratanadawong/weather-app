To Do:
- Unit tests for API endpoints
- Unit tests for helpers
- Style the city selector
- Choose methodology for deciding which weather reading is the "true" reading

Enrichments:
- Allow frontend to display C or F options
- Associate colour of temperature reading with blue/red depending on how hot/cold
- May be worth considering creating a common node_modules to reduce redundancy (Axios)
- Detail view for weather
- Build query string for app for shareability
- Set up webpack to serve up API and app simultaneously for easy testing
